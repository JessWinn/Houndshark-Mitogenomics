# Bioinformatics pipeline of Winn et al. (2022) - Triakid Mitophlyogenomics and systematic implications 
***[Simo: I am struggling to follow your workflow. May you please name your scripts appropriately i.e STEP-1_XXXX, STEP-2_XXX?]***

## STEP 1: Quality Control of Ion GeneStudioâ„¢ S5 data
***[Simo: How was quality control carried out? Provide a brief description of how the (1) sequence quality was checked, (2) low quality bases were trimmed and (3) adapters contamination was checked and removed.]***

## STEP 2: Mitogenome assemblies  

## STEP 3: Mitogenome annotations

## STEP 4: Mitophylogenomics

### STEP 4.1: Ingroup and outgroup mitogenome retrieval from GenBank 
List of mitochondrial genomes of the order Carcharhiniformes from Kousteni et al. 2021 and Wang et al. 2022, which include additional outgroup representatives from the orders Lamniformes and Orectolobiformes. 
Use Batch Entrez (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/batchentrez) to download entire mitogenome records in GenBank (full) format.
Use the file 'STEP-1_mitogenomes_genebak.list' to retrieve records and save file as 'kousteni-wang.gb' in a folder named ***data***, already containing newly assembled mitogenomes also in GenBank (full) format.
